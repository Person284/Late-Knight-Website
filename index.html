                    On Saturday, December 2nd, PLU Late Knight hosted their second episode of Season 9. This comedic performance included the main character from the classic holiday story, “How the Grinch Stole Christmas,” making for an extra special episode. Combining laughter and wit, the award-winning comedy group held a performance that had the crowd engaged the entire time. Third-year student Parker Brown says “It was very charming and creative… the vibe was there, it was a great time.”

                    The evening included a live gingerbread house-making contest, utilizing four audience participants to battle it out in a race against the clock. Josiah Devine Johnson, Valentina Cervantes, and the opposing team Abigail and Matthew Tolar worked through three sets of surprise challenges throughout the competition, keeping guests on their toes. After a whirlwind of mitten-wearing and house-swapping, Johnson and Cervantes applauded their competition's win.

                    In addition to a lively holiday performance, Late Knight and its audience were joined by a local band, “Up In The Attic”. The up-and-coming group is based in the Seattle/Tacoma area, creating indie music for everyone. Their performance was a fantastic way to end this episode of Late Knight, providing a look into the current music scene. Music by “Up In The Attic” is available on all streaming platforms, and can be found on Instagram @upintheatticmusic.
